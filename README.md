## üèó Architecture

This project uses **Clean Architecture**:

1. **Domain Layer**  
   - Contains `Task` model and `UseCases` (Add, Edit, Delete, Complete, GetTasks).  
   - Pure Kotlin, no Android dependencies.

2. **Data Layer**  
   - Room database for local persistence.  
   - Repository interfaces and implementations.  
   - Handles data mapping between Room entities and domain models.

3. **Presentation Layer**  
   - Jetpack Compose UI: `TaskScreen`, `TaskItem`, `TaskBottomSheet`.  
   - `TaskViewModel` holds state and survives rotation.  
   - Hilt for dependency injection.
